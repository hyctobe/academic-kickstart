Brett Koon wanted to know that there was more to his life. He wanted to explore all the possibilities concerning life. He desired to find out if there was something beyond himself,  which in turn threw him deep into explorationâ€¦

Eventually, he discovered his answer: **He was not an idea or self image of who he "thought" he was.** Once he became aware of this, all of his life changed.

Brett has been an inspirational speaker for over 20 years. His talks are focused on helping people *move beyond their fears and limitations*, but if folks are interested, he also delves into the spiritual aspect.

After gaining his newfound awareness, Brett dug more into who he is and how he could *use* his understanding to guide people on their own paths to sustaining peace, joy, and love.

Now he helps people from around the world.

From free guided meditations on his YouTube channel, "*Brett Koon*," to the many other services he provides, you can feel at ease knowing he is here to guide you toward a life of nothing but internal peace. *Find joy in the world that surrounds you* and love not only yourself but the reality in which you live and the people who manifest into your life.
