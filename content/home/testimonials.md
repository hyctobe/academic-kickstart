> Hi Brett,<br>
I just wanted to say, I thought you did a fabulous job! I thoroughly loved hearing you speak and was blown away by your passion and clarity.
It felt like you were, more than ever, truly believing in your message and it was coming from the depths of you. The message flowed so beautifully. I know you have been leading regular meditations which I imagine has helped you ground yourself even more than before. Gratefully.

> I started listening to Brett's meditations about 6 months ago. His comforting voice and presence immediately resonated with me so I knew I had found something special and I was right !!
His guided meditations have enabled me to find more peace within myself and to experience more deeply my oneness with God.
In addition, Brett also shares words of wisdom from many other spiritual teachers which have also been very helpful in my spiritual growth.
I highly recommend listening to Brett's meditations if you want to experience more peace, love and joy in your life

I've known Brett for over 25 years and the one thing that stands out to me consistently (and warms my heart) is his ever loving integrity, truth, presence and respect for others.  It's always a refreshing conversation because I can count on the sharing and wisdom to be deep and inspirational - and that is one thing I very much value.  I appreciate how real Brett is as he works to integrate lifes lessons and teachings into his own life. He invites those who are interested to take a look at what is possible in the well of our being and encourages a personal evolution.  His teachings and meditations are a gift to humanity!

> A year ago, Brett helped me at one of the most difficult times of my life. I was having tremendous anxiety and panic attacks as a result of a medical diagnosis that was consuming my life. I had never heard of the condition “Tinnitus” nor did I know what it was (ringing in the ears). I had a very severe case that would not allow me any rest or peace in my life. It got so bad, I could no longer cope with life as it was and there is nothing medical science can do. It is permanent and It is not curable, nor is it controllable. My only way to survive this was to learn how to live with it.<br><br>
I knew Brett was deeply involved in meditation and mindfulness as a friend of several years, so I contacted him for help. I had tried meditation by reading books without much success in the past and I needed immediate help. Brett suggested we meet at least weekly (if not more) in order to get the quickest results. We worked together for the next few months. He taught me meditation and specifically “Mindful” meditation. Slowly, I started gaining control of my anxiety and became more accepting of my condition. During this time, I had some pretty serious meltdowns. Brett was always there for me. He even meditated with me over the phone to calm me down. I will never be able to convey the extent of my gratitude to Brett for all he did for me, but I believe he knows.<br><br>
If you are considering learning or pursuing meditation, I cannot recommend Brett enough.

> I met Brett at The Interfaith Center for Spiritual Growth where I’ve been Music Director for 14 years. I’ve had the pleasure of hearing Brett share his heartfelt meditations and talks. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed working with him.   His talks are given from the heart and his meditations are sincere, warm and uplifting and especially needed in these changing times.  His kindness, presence and humor shines through whether it be in a talk, a meditation or in a conversation with someone. Brett would make a wonderful speaker, meditator or spiritual life coach at a Spiritual Center.

> I have been participating in Brett's guided meditation for several years. He has shared much wisdom and is a good listener. He cares greatly that participants are growing spiritually, and his encouraging nature does just that. I also participated in two retreats and highly recommend them in the future. With gratitude and peace.

> When I first met Brett, I could sense the amazing kind person he is. I’ve been listening and participating in Brett’s meditations for about two years. He is quite the gentle soul who deeply cares about people and loves guiding them from a noisy mind to a calm and peaceful mind. I thoroughly love Brett and his meditations and highly recommend him to anyone interested in connecting to that deeper part of themselves.

> Meditation was wonderful today, as always. I really liked that you mentioned that our natural state is peace, joy, and love. I have a client who is feeling fearful, but she meditates, so I'm going to suggest your site (website). Thank you! I appreciate you!

> Being that I'm a very sensitive person, with all the craziness going on in the world, I sometimes find myself anxious and ungrounded. I am so thankful to have found Brett. He is so great at leading meditation! He helps me to empty out all the noises in my space and just "be.” To empty out all my thoughts and find that still place within. Brett has a very calming demeanor and always seems to say just the right things in the guided meditation that really speaks to me. I am thankful to have found him!

> I cannot speak for others; however, Brett is such an authentic teacher, student, and friend! He is the voice of calm. His meditation creates awareness of your inner soul. If you are ready for an awakening in these crazy times, he is a must to find your calm.
