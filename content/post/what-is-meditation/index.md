There is a lot of talk about meditation these days, but what is meditation really all about. At the very core essence of meditation, it is simply sitting and being.

What does it mean "being"? It means that you are just observing the breath, at least as far as mindfulness meditation goes, and there is no trying or doing involved, you are just simply sitting without judgment and without using the mind. In that beingness, there is nothing to do other than just simply be aware, and just sit and be still.

When you are being aware of your breath, thoughts will present themselves. It doesn't matter whether you have one thought or one thousand thoughts if you are not empowering the thoughts in any way. As soon as, though, you start believing the thoughts in your mind, you are inviting trouble into the door.

Meditation is a way of transcending the mind so that you are not caught in all of the constant thought streams of negativity that are coming from the mind. Instead, you are connecting with a silent intelligence within, your true self.

Every single thing that you are struggling with, every single thing that is causing you stress or suffering, all of your judgments, all of your guilt, all of your shame, and all the blame of yourself and others, is all coming from the mind.

The problem is not that you have negative thoughts, though, the problem is that you believe the negative thoughts to be true. As soon as you buy into the thought as if it's the truth, suffering immediately begins.

Why is that? Think of the mind as a giant recorder. It records every experience of every situation you have ever had. It then assigns a value to it, this is “good” or this is “bad”. Then, when a similar situation presents itself, the mind will immediately react in which way “it thinks” is best.

As we are growing up, we do need discernment in different ways, but as we want more out of life, we see that it is the very thing the mind has recorded that locks us into limited thinking. If we are simply responding in a way that is rooted in the past, how can we possibly enter any situation with a freshness, a newness, or an innocence.

Let’s face it, many people simply respond to a situation sounding like a robot and regurgitating old information without offering a new or fresh perspective for the conversation or the situation at hand. No wonder we get bored, as well as others around us, many of us already know what’s going to be said or done.

A common question I ask to people in meditation is, "If you are your thoughts, then who is it that is aware of the thoughts?" If you take a deeper look, you will see that who you truly are is the one that is simply watching, observing, just simply being aware of the thoughts. The core truth of who you are is also the one being aware of the breath.

As we begin to recognize the very thing that limits us are the thoughts we identify with as the truth, the thoughts and old beliefs begin to more easily fall away and a freshness and freedom of being begins to arise.

To take it a step further, your core self is the one that is aware of all of it; the thoughts, the breath, the body, the five senses, the beliefs, the experiences, and the feelings.

The more you meditate, you begin to realize that you are more than your thoughts, beliefs, feelings, experiences, your physical form, **and the ideas of who you think you are**.

It is from this place of awareness that you are able to simply be the one who is aware of the movie of life. You are not a character in the movie of life, you are the one watching the movie.

As you connect with the awareness of it all, your thoughts and beliefs lose their power so that you can reconnect and be the authentic you.

In addition, meditation also teaches that you don't have to get in your head to figure life out. In fact, the more you can let go of your need to figure things out, your need to control life, and perhaps your trying to manipulate life, then you can begin to have a trust and faith that life, God, the universe, or whatever you want to call it, is always on your side. You have a trust and faith that life is bringing you exactly what you need to awaken you to the truth of who you are.

When you realize that your true creative self and your true intelligence is all beyond the mind, there is a tremendous freedom that presents itself. It is a freedom of not being in this constant busyness of the mind and of trying to solve life's problems but instead, there is a deep surrender and trust with life that allows you to flow with everything that presents itself.

One definition of stress is, wanting life to be different than what it is. As soon as you start resisting life, fighting against it, or feeling that you have been wronged in some way, there will be a stress and suffering that ensue. But when, however, you can release your attachments to life and flow with it, you can be at peace with whatever happens in your life.

Meditation can teach you all of this. It teaches you to move beyond your head and your limited beliefs that lock you into a false reality. As you disempower the thoughts and begin to realize your core truth, you begin to flow with all of life and your true self, which is always rooted in love, peace and joy.

That is only a portion of what meditation can teach. Ultimately, though, as you meditate, you will see that life is a meditation. It is this beautiful unfolding that you can flow with and experience the peace, joy and love that is not only available, but is actually the truth of who you are within every present moment.

Lastly, I would say meditation is about coming to a place of peace within yourself regardless of what is going on outside of yourself. True change always happens from within. The more you can accept this rather than blaming other people or situations, all of life gets easier.

Life truly does not have to be hard, no matter what situation you are in, because meditation offers a way of letting go of all the limiting and self-sabotaging beliefs of the mind. Then, you can ultimately connect with the beautiful stillness and freedom that not only lies within, but is actually your true nature.
